# Working Papers

<a href="http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM.pdf"> **Temperature and Bureaucracy: empirical analysis on auditing reports in Brazil**</a>, <a href="https://mizuhirosuzuki.github.io/"> _with Mizuhiro Suzuki_</a>
> We evaluate the relationship between temperature shocks and the performance of bureacracy. We study a program in Brazil that randomly allocated audit teams to municipalities all over the country and we find a positive effect of temperature on reported levels of corruption.

<a href="http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM2.pdf"> **Temperature, Effort, and Achievement: evidence from a large-scale standardized exam in Brazil**</a>, <a href="https://mizuhirosuzuki.github.io/"> _with Mizuhiro Suzuki_</a>   
> We provide empirical evidence on how the exam stakes affect the sensitivity of performance to temperature. We explore the unique Brazilian context in which the stakes of a large-scale standardized exam change from relatively low to high. Using within-individual variations in exam scores and temperature across two exam days, we find a negative impact of high temperature on exam scores. The effects are non-linear, especially when the temperature increases to the high 30s. When we interact temperature with the proportion of universities in a locality using the national exam as the primary admission criteria, we find that the higher the stakes, the smaller the effects of temperature on exam performance.

**Affirmative action, college access and major choice: Redistribution and opportunity for social mobility**      
> This paper evaluates an affirmative action policy enacted at a flagship university in Brazil. The policy targets applicants from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, aiming to address the structural inequality in access to college. I find the policy resulted in strong redistributive effects, mostly towards selective fields. Targeted applicants also become much more likely to apply to a selective major. However, this behavior change partially results in strategic mistakes, with some applicants reaching too high, missing their chance to be accepted in college.
      
**Affirmative action and demand for schooling: evidence from nation-wide policies**, _with Ursula Mello_      
> We study the effects of AA policies on pre-college incentives to invest in human capital by exploring national affirmative action policies implemented in Brazil. We focus on how high school persistence and demand for college changed as some universities became more accessible to the beneficiary group at the same time as it became more competitive to the non-beneficiaries.
