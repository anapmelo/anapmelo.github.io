# Working Papers

<a href="http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM.pdf"> **Temperature and Bureaucracy: empirical analysis on auditing reports in Brazil**</a>, <a href="https://mizuhirosuzuki.github.io/"> _with Mizuhiro Suzuki_</a>
> We evaluate the relationship between temperature shocks and the performance of bureacracy. We study a program in Brazil that randomly allocated audit teams to municipalities all over the country and we find a positive effect of temperature on reported levels of corruption.

<a href="http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_MM2.pdf"> **Temperature, Effort, and Achievement: evidence from a large-scale standardized exam in Brazil**</a>, <a href="https://mizuhirosuzuki.github.io/"> _with Mizuhiro Suzuki_</a>   
> We provide empirical evidence on how the exam stakes affect the sensitivity of performance to temperature. We explore the unique Brazilian context in which the stakes of a large-scale standardized exam change from relatively low to high. Using within-individual variations in exam scores and temperature across two exam days, we find a negative impact of high temperature on exam scores. The effects are non-linear, especially when the temperature increases to the high 30s. When we interact temperature with the proportion of universities in a locality using the national exam as the primary admission criteria, we find that the higher the stakes, the smaller the effects of temperature on exam performance.

<a href="http://anapmelo.github.io/files/manuscript_Melo.pdf"> **Affirmative action, college access and major choice** </a>     
> In this paper, I study the effects of an affirmative action policy targeting low-socioeconomic status applicants at a flagship university in Brazil. Results show the quota-type affirmative action policy redistributed college seats towards targeted applicants, mainly by increasing their representation in selective, high-return majors. This gain in cross-field diversity happened with only a marginal decrease in the average achievement of the incoming cohort. The policy also reduced the gap in applications to selective majors between high and low socioeconomic status individuals by more than 50 percent. However, most of the effects on major-choice happened among individuals less likely to be accepted to a selective major, suggesting an increase in strategic mistakes in major choice. My findings contribute to our understanding of how affirmative action policies can mitigate the socioeconomic gap in both college attendance and field of study, but improvements in the admissions mechanism design remain necessary.
      
**Affirmative action and demand for schooling: evidence from nation-wide policies**, _with Ursula Mello_      
> We study the effects of AA policies on pre-college incentives to invest in human capital by exploring national affirmative action policies implemented in Brazil. We focus on how high school persistence and demand for college changed as some universities became more accessible to the beneficiary group at the same time as it became more competitive to the non-beneficiaries.
